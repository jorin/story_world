== Story World

Story World is an EmberJS app on top of a Ruby on Rails back end, intended to manage a collection of characters engaging in activity represented as events occurring at locations.

The intent is to provide a collaborative tool for laying out story timelines with shared characters, resulting in maps of activity for characters and locations.
